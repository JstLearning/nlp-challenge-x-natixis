       "'When we convened in Jackson Hole in August 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee\\'s (FOMC) target for the federal funds rate was 5-1/4 percent. Sixteen months later, with the financial crisis in full swing, the FOMC had lowered the target for the federal funds rate to nearly zero, thereby entering the unfamiliar territory of having to conduct monetary policy with the policy interest rate at its effective lower bound. The unusual severity of the recession and ongoing strains in financial markets made the challenges facing monetary policymakers all the greater. Today I will review the evolution of U.S. monetary policy since late 2007. My focus will be the Federal Reserve\\'s experience with nontraditional policy tools, notably those based on the management of the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet and on its public communications. I\\'ll discuss what we have learned about the efficacy and drawbacks of these less familiar forms of monetary policy, and I\\'ll talk about the implications for the Federal Reserve\\'s ongoing efforts to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability. Monetary Policy in 2007 and 2008 When significant financial stresses first emerged, in August 2007, the FOMC responded quickly, first through liquidity actions--cutting the discount rate and extending term loans to banks--and then, in September, by lowering the target for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points. 1 As further indications of economic weakness appeared over subsequent months, the Committee reduced its target for the federal funds rate by a cumulative 325 basis points, leaving the target at 2 percent by the spring of 2008. The Committee held rates constant over the summer as it monitored economic and financial conditions. When the crisis intensified markedly in the fall, the Committee responded by cutting the target for the federal funds rate by 100 basis points in October, with half of this easing coming as part of an unprecedented coordinated interest rate cut by six major central banks. Then, in December 2008, as evidence of a dramatic slowdown mounted, the Committee reduced its target to a range of 0 to 25 basis points, effectively its lower bound. That target range remains in place today. Despite the easing of monetary policy, dysfunction in credit markets continued to worsen. As you know, in the latter part of 2008 and early 2009, the Federal Reserve took extraordinary steps to provide liquidity and support credit market functioning, including the establishment of a number of emergency lending facilities and the creation or extension of currency swap agreements with 14 central banks around the world.2 In its role as banking regulator, the Federal Reserve also led stress tests of the largest U.S. bank holding companies, setting the stage for the companies to raise capital. These actions--along with a host of interventions by other policymakers in the United States and throughout the world--helped stabilize global financial markets, which in turn served to check the deterioration in the real economy and the emergence of deflationary pressures. Unfortunately, although it is likely that even worse outcomes had been averted, the damage to the economy was severe. The unemployment rate in the United States rose from about 6 percent in September 2008 to nearly 9 percent by April 2009--it would peak at 10 percent in October--while inflation declined sharply. As the crisis crested, and with the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound, the FOMC turned to nontraditional policy approaches to support the recovery. As the Committee embarked on this path, we were guided by some general principles and some insightful academic work but--with the important exception of the Japanese case--limited historical experience. As a result, central bankers in the United States, and those in other advanced economies facing similar problems, have been in the process of learning by doing. I will discuss some of what we have learned, beginning with our experience conducting policy using the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet, then turn to our use of communications tools. Balance Sheet Tools In using the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet as a tool for achieving its mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability, the FOMC has focused on the acquisition of longer-term securities--specifically, Treasury and agency securities, which are the principal types of securities that the Federal Reserve is permitted to buy under the Federal Reserve Act.3 One mechanism through which such purchases are believed to affect the economy is the so-called portfolio balance channel, which is based on the ideas of a number of well-known monetary economists, including James Tobin, Milton Friedman, Franco Modigliani, Karl Brunner, and Allan Meltzer. The key premise underlying this channel is that, for a variety of reasons, different classes of financial assets are not perfect substitutes in investors\\' portfolios.4 For example, some institutional investors face regulatory restrictions on the types of securities they can hold, retail investors may be reluctant to hold certain types of assets because of high transactions or information costs, and some assets have risk characteristics that are difficult or costly to hedge. Imperfect substitutability of assets implies that changes in the supplies of various assets available to private investors may affect the prices and yields of those assets. Thus, Federal Reserve purchases of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), for example, should raise the prices and lower the yields of those securities; moreover, as investors rebalance their portfolios by replacing the MBS sold to the Federal Reserve with other assets, the prices of the assets they buy should rise and their yields decline as well. Declining yields and rising asset prices ease overall financial conditions and stimulate economic activity through channels similar to those for conventional monetary policy. Following this logic, Tobin suggested that purchases of longer-term securities by the Federal Reserve during the Great Depression could have helped the U.S. economy recover despite the fact that short-term rates were close to zero, and Friedman argued for large-scale purchases of long-term bonds by the Bank of Japan to help overcome Japan\\'s deflationary trap.5  Large-scale asset purchases can influence financial conditions and the broader economy through other channels as well. For instance, they can signal that the central bank intends to pursue a persistently more accommodative policy stance than previously thought, thereby lowering investors\\' expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate and putting additional downward pressure on long-term interest rates, particularly in real terms. Such signaling can also increase household and business confidence by helping to diminish concerns about \"tail\" risks such as deflation. During stressful periods, asset purchases may also improve the functioning of financial markets, thereby easing credit conditions in some sectors. With the space for further cuts in the target for the federal funds rate increasingly limited, in late 2008 the Federal Reserve initiated a series of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs). In November, the FOMC announced a program to purchase a total of $600 billion in agency MBS and agency debt.6 In March 2009, the FOMC expanded this purchase program substantially, announcing that it would purchase up to $1.25 trillion of agency MBS, up to $200 billion of agency debt, and up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury debt.7 These purchases were completed, with minor adjustments, in early 2010.8 In November 2010, the FOMC announced that it would further expand the Federal Reserve\\'s security holdings by purchasing an additional $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over a period ending in mid-2011.9  About a year ago, the FOMC introduced a variation on its earlier purchase programs, known as the maturity extension program (MEP), under which the Federal Reserve would purchase $400 billion of long-term Treasury securities and sell an equivalent amount of shorter-term Treasury securities over the period ending in June 2012.10 The FOMC subsequently extended the MEP through the end of this year.11 By reducing the average maturity of the securities held by the public, the MEP puts additional downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and further eases overall financial conditions. How effective are balance sheet policies? After nearly four years of experience with large-scale asset purchases, a substantial body of empirical work on their effects has emerged. Generally, this research finds that the Federal Reserve\\'s large-scale purchases have significantly lowered long-term Treasury yields. For example, studies have found that the $1.7 trillion in purchases of Treasury and agency securities under the first LSAP program reduced the yield on 10-year Treasury securities by between 40 and 110 basis points. The $600 billion in Treasury purchases under the second LSAP program has been credited with lowering 10-year yields by an additional 15 to 45 basis points.12 Three studies considering the cumulative influence of all the Federal Reserve\\'s asset purchases, including those made under the MEP, found total effects between 80 and 120 basis points on the 10-year Treasury yield.13 These effects are economically meaningful. Importantly, the effects of LSAPs do not appear to be confined to longer-term Treasury yields. Notably, LSAPs have been found to be associated with significant declines in the yields on both corporate bonds and MBS.14 The first purchase program, in particular, has been linked to substantial reductions in MBS yields and retail mortgage rates. LSAPs also appear to have boosted stock prices, presumably both by lowering discount rates and by improving the economic outlook; it is probably not a coincidence that the sustained recovery in U.S. equity prices began in March 2009, shortly after the FOMC\\'s decision to greatly expand securities purchases. This effect is potentially important because stock values affect both consumption and investment decisions. While there is substantial evidence that the Federal Reserve\\'s asset purchases have lowered longer-term yields and eased broader financial conditions, obtaining precise estimates of the effects of these operations on the broader economy is inherently difficult, as the counterfactual--how the economy would have performed in the absence of the Federal Reserve\\'s actions--cannot be directly observed. If we are willing to take as a working assumption that the effects of easier financial conditions on the economy are similar to those observed historically, then econometric models can be used to estimate the effects of LSAPs on the economy. Model simulations conducted at the Federal Reserve generally find that the securities purchase programs have provided significant help for the economy. For example, a study using the Board\\'s FRB/US model of the economy found that, as of 2012, the first two rounds of LSAPs may have raised the level of output by almost 3 percent and increased private payroll employment by more than 2 million jobs, relative to what otherwise would have occurred.15 The Bank of England has used LSAPs in a manner similar to that of the Federal Reserve, so it is of interest that researchers have found the financial and macroeconomic effects of the British programs to be qualitatively similar to those in the United States.16  To be sure, these estimates of the macroeconomic effects of LSAPs should be treated with caution. It is likely that the crisis and the recession have attenuated some of the normal transmission channels of monetary policy relative to what is assumed in the models; for example, restrictive mortgage underwriting standards have reduced the effects of lower mortgage rates. Further, the estimated macroeconomic effects depend on uncertain estimates of the persistence of the effects of LSAPs on financial conditions.17 Overall, however, a balanced reading of the evidence supports the conclusion that central bank securities purchases have provided meaningful support to the economic recovery while mitigating deflationary risks. Now I will turn to our use of communications tools. Communication Tools Clear communication is always important in central banking, but it can be especially important when economic conditions call for further policy stimulus but the policy rate is already at its effective lower bound. In particular, forward guidance that lowers private-sector expectations regarding future short-term rates should cause longer-term interest rates to decline, leading to more accommodative financial conditions.18  The Federal Reserve has made considerable use of forward guidance as a policy tool.19 From March 2009 through June 2011, the FOMC\\'s postmeeting statement noted that economic conditions \"are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.\"20 At the August 2011 meeting, the Committee made its guidance more precise by stating that economic conditions would likely warrant that the federal funds rate remain exceptionally low \"at least through mid-2013.\"21 At the beginning of this year, the FOMC extended the anticipated period of exceptionally low rates further, to \"at least through late 2014,\" guidance that has been reaffirmed at subsequent meetings.22 As the language indicates, this guidance is not an unconditional promise; rather, it is a statement about the FOMC\\'s collective judgment regarding the path of policy that is likely to prove appropriate, given the Committee\\'s objectives and its outlook for the economy. The views of Committee members regarding the likely timing of policy firming represent a balance of many factors, but the current forward guidance is broadly consistent with prescriptions coming from a range of standard benchmarks, including simple policy rules and optimal control methods.23 Some of the policy rules informing the forward guidance relate policy interest rates to familiar determinants, such as inflation and the output gap. But a number of considerations also argue for planning to keep rates low for a longer time than implied by policy rules developed during more normal periods. These considerations include the need to take out insurance against the realization of downside risks, which are particularly difficult to manage when rates are close to their effective lower bound; the possibility that, because of various unusual headwinds slowing the recovery, the economy needs more policy support than usual at this stage of the cycle; and the need to compensate for limits to policy accommodation resulting from the lower bound on rates.24  Has the forward guidance been effective? It is certainly true that, over time, both investors and private forecasters have pushed out considerably the date at which they expect the federal funds rate to begin to rise; moreover, current policy expectations appear to align well with the FOMC\\'s forward guidance. To be sure, the changes over time in when the private sector expects the federal funds rate to begin firming resulted in part from the same deterioration of the economic outlook that led the FOMC to introduce and then extend its forward guidance. But the private sector\\'s revised outlook for the policy rate also appears to reflect a growing appreciation of how forceful the FOMC intends to be in supporting a sustainable recovery. For example, since 2009, forecasters participating in the Blue Chip survey have repeatedly marked down their projections of the unemployment rate they expect to prevail at the time that the FOMC begins to lift the target for the federal funds rate away from zero. Thus, the Committee\\'s forward guidance may have conveyed a greater willingness to maintain accommodation than private forecasters had previously believed.25 The behavior of financial market prices in periods around changes in the forward guidance is also consistent with the view that the guidance has affected policy expectations.26  Making Policy with Nontraditional Tools: A Cost-Benefit Framework Making monetary policy with nontraditional tools is challenging. In particular, our experience with these tools remains limited. In this context, the FOMC carefully compares the expected benefits and costs of proposed policy actions. The potential benefit of policy action, of course, is the possibility of better economic outcomes--outcomes more consistent with the FOMC\\'s dual mandate. In light of the evidence I discussed, it appears reasonable to conclude that nontraditional policy tools have been and can continue to be effective in providing financial accommodation, though we are less certain about the magnitude and persistence of these effects than we are about those of more-traditional policies. The possible benefits of an action, however, must be considered alongside its potential costs. I will focus now on the potential costs of LSAPs. One possible cost of conducting additional LSAPs is that these operations could impair the functioning of securities markets. As I noted, the Federal Reserve is limited by law mainly to the purchase of Treasury and agency securities; the supply of those securities is large but finite, and not all of the supply is actively traded. Conceivably, if the Federal Reserve became too dominant a buyer in certain segments of these markets, trading among private agents could dry up, degrading liquidity and price discovery. As the global financial system depends on deep and liquid markets for U.S. Treasury securities, significant impairment of those markets would be costly, and, in particular, could impede the transmission of monetary policy. For example, market disruptions could lead to higher liquidity premiums on Treasury securities, which would run counter to the policy goal of reducing Treasury yields. However, although market capacity could ultimately become an issue, to this point we have seen few if any problems in the markets for Treasury or agency securities, private-sector holdings of securities remain large, and trading among private market participants remains robust. A second potential cost of additional securities purchases is that substantial further expansions of the balance sheet could reduce public confidence in the Fed\\'s ability to exit smoothly from its accommodative policies at the appropriate time. Even if unjustified, such a reduction in confidence might increase the risk of a costly unanchoring of inflation expectations, leading in turn to financial and economic instability. It is noteworthy, however, that the expansion of the balance sheet to date has not materially affected inflation expectations, likely in part because of the great emphasis the Federal Reserve has placed on developing tools to ensure that we can normalize monetary policy when appropriate, even if our securities holdings remain large. In particular, the FOMC will be able to put upward pressure on short-term interest rates by raising the interest rate it pays banks for reserves they hold at the Fed. Upward pressure on rates can also be achieved by using reserve-draining tools or by selling securities from the Federal Reserve\\'s portfolio, thus reversing the effects achieved by LSAPs. The FOMC has spent considerable effort planning and testing our exit strategy and will act decisively to execute it at the appropriate time. A third cost to be weighed is that of risks to financial stability. For example, some observers have raised concerns that, by driving longer-term yields lower, nontraditional policies could induce an imprudent reach for yield by some investors and thereby threaten financial stability. Of course, one objective of both traditional and nontraditional policy during recoveries is to promote a return to productive risk-taking; as always, the goal is to strike the appropriate balance. Moreover, a stronger recovery is itself clearly helpful for financial stability. In assessing this risk, it is important to note that the Federal Reserve, both on its own and in collaboration with other members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, has substantially expanded its monitoring of the financial system and modified its supervisory approach to take a more systemic perspective. We have seen little evidence thus far of unsafe buildups of risk or leverage, but we will continue both our careful oversight and the implementation of financial regulatory reforms aimed at reducing systemic risk. A fourth potential cost of balance sheet policies is the possibility that the Federal Reserve could incur financial losses should interest rates rise to an unexpected extent. Extensive analyses suggest that, from a purely fiscal perspective, the odds are strong that the Fed\\'s asset purchases will make money for the taxpayers, reducing the federal deficit and debt.27 And, of course, to the extent that monetary policy helps strengthen the economy and raise incomes, the benefits for the U.S. fiscal position would be substantial. In any case, this purely fiscal perspective is too narrow: Because Americans are workers and consumers as well as taxpayers, monetary policy can achieve the most for the country by focusing generally on improving economic performance rather than narrowly on possible gains or losses on the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet. In sum, both the benefits and costs of nontraditional monetary policies are uncertain; in all likelihood, they will also vary over time, depending on factors such as the state of the economy and financial markets and the extent of prior Federal Reserve asset purchases. Moreover, nontraditional policies have potential costs that may be less relevant for traditional policies. For these reasons, the hurdle for using nontraditional policies should be higher than for traditional policies. At the same time, the costs of nontraditional policies, when considered carefully, appear manageable, implying that we should not rule out the further use of such policies if economic conditions warrant. Economic Prospects The accommodative monetary policies I have reviewed today, both traditional and nontraditional, have provided important support to the economic recovery while helping to maintain price stability. As of July, the unemployment rate had fallen to 8.3 percent from its cyclical peak of 10 percent and payrolls had risen by 4 million jobs from their low point. And despite periodic concerns about deflation risks, on the one hand, and repeated warnings that excessive policy accommodation would ignite inflation, on the other hand, inflation (except for temporary deviations caused primarily by swings in commodity prices) has remained near the Committee\\'s 2 percent objective and inflation expectations have remained stable. Key sectors such as manufacturing, housing, and international trade have strengthened, firms\\' investment in equipment and software has rebounded, and conditions in financial and credit markets have improved. Notwithstanding these positive signs, the economic situation is obviously far from satisfactory. The unemployment rate remains more than 2 percentage points above what most FOMC participants see as its longer-run normal value, and other indicators--such as the labor force participation rate and the number of people working part time for economic reasons--confirm that labor force utilization remains at very low levels. Further, the rate of improvement in the labor market has been painfully slow. I have noted on other occasions that the declines in unemployment we have seen would likely continue only if economic growth picked up to a rate above its longer-term trend.28 In fact, growth in recent quarters has been tepid, and so, not surprisingly, we have seen no net improvement in the unemployment rate since January. Unless the economy begins to grow more quickly than it has recently, the unemployment rate is likely to remain far above levels consistent with maximum employment for some time. In light of the policy actions the FOMC has taken to date, as well as the economy\\'s natural recovery mechanisms, we might have hoped for greater progress by now in returning to maximum employment. Some have taken the lack of progress as evidence that the financial crisis caused structural damage to the economy, rendering the current levels of unemployment impervious to additional monetary accommodation. The literature on this issue is extensive, and I cannot fully review it today.29 However, following every previous U.S. recession since World War II, the unemployment rate has returned close to its pre-recession level, and, although the recent recession was unusually deep, I see little evidence of substantial structural change in recent years. Rather than attributing the slow recovery to longer-term structural factors, I see growth being held back currently by a number of headwinds. First, although the housing sector has shown signs of improvement, housing activity remains at low levels and is contributing much less to the recovery than would normally be expected at this stage of the cycle. Second, fiscal policy, at both the federal and state and local levels, has become an important headwind for the pace of economic growth. Notwithstanding some recent improvement in tax revenues, state and local governments still face tight budget situations and continue to cut real spending and employment. Real purchases are also declining at the federal level. Uncertainties about fiscal policy, notably about the resolution of the so-called fiscal cliff and the lifting of the debt ceiling, are probably also restraining activity, although the magnitudes of these effects are hard to judge.30 It is critical that fiscal policymakers put in place a credible plan that sets the federal budget on a sustainable trajectory in the medium and longer runs. However, policymakers should take care to avoid a sharp near-term fiscal contraction that could endanger the recovery. Third, stresses in credit and financial markets continue to restrain the economy. Earlier in the recovery, limited credit availability was an important factor holding back growth, and tight borrowing conditions for some potential homebuyers and small businesses remain a problem today. More recently, however, a major source of financial strains has been uncertainty about developments in Europe. These strains are most problematic for the Europeans, of course, but through global trade and financial linkages, the effects of the European situation on the U.S. economy are significant as well. Some recent policy proposals in Europe have been quite constructive, in my view, and I urge our European colleagues to press ahead with policy initiatives to resolve the crisis. Conclusion Early in my tenure as a member of the Board of Governors, I gave a speech that considered options for monetary policy when the short-term policy interest rate is close to its effective lower bound.31 I was reacting to common assertions at the time that monetary policymakers would be \"out of ammunition\" as the federal funds rate came closer to zero. I argued that, to the contrary, policy could still be effective near the lower bound. Now, with several years of experience with nontraditional policies both in the United States and in other advanced economies, we know more about how such policies work. It seems clear, based on this experience, that such policies can be effective, and that, in their absence, the 2007-09 recession would have been deeper and the current recovery would have been slower than has actually occurred. As I have discussed today, it is also true that nontraditional policies are relatively more difficult to apply, at least given the present state of our knowledge. Estimates of the effects of nontraditional policies on economic activity and inflation are uncertain, and the use of nontraditional policies involves costs beyond those generally associated with more-standard policies. Consequently, the bar for the use of nontraditional policies is higher than for traditional policies. In addition, in the present context, nontraditional policies share the limitations of monetary policy more generally: Monetary policy cannot achieve by itself what a broader and more balanced set of economic policies might achieve; in particular, it cannot neutralize the fiscal and financial risks that the country faces. It certainly cannot fine-tune economic outcomes. As we assess the benefits and costs of alternative policy approaches, though, we must not lose sight of the daunting economic challenges that confront our nation. The stagnation of the labor market in particular is a grave concern not only because of the enormous suffering and waste of human talent it entails, but also because persistently high levels of unemployment will wreak structural damage on our economy that could last for many years. Over the past five years, the Federal Reserve has acted to support economic growth and foster job creation, and it is important to achieve further progress, particularly in the labor market. Taking due account of the uncertainties and limits of its policy tools, the Federal Reserve will provide additional policy accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.

      "is period was the Basel II package of changes to capital requirements, an exercise whose shortcomings included an enhancement, rather than diminution,\n",
      " of regulatory incentive for procyclicality in bank lending, and thus could arguably increase systemic risk. By the time financial stress began rising\n",
      " rapidly in the second half of 2007, systemic risk and financial instability had come to seem more theoretical than real to many regulators, academics\n",

      "staffs identified risks that might be building and, in general terms, the need for macroprudential regulation to complement traditional microprudentia\n",

      " legislative response to the financial crisis. The necessarily somewhat extemporized character of Dodd-Frank has had several consequences for the deve\n",
      "lopment of financial stability regulation. First, many of the new authorities and requirements of Dodd-Frank require extensive elaboration through adm\n",
      "inistrative rulemaking, often coordinated or agreed among three or more agencies. Second, as I will explain in a moment, the provisions of the law tha\n",

      " standard. This is not unusual for statutes in new areas of regulation, but it still poses a challenge for regulators, particularly in the early stage\n",
      "s of implementation or enforcement. Third, broad as Dodd-Frank is in some respects, it does not grant direct regulatory authority in some areas that a\n",
      "cademic and agency analysis suggests may pose systemic risk. Finally, the law made important institutional changes, creating novel governmental entiti\n",
      "es specifically designed to address financial stability, and binding existing agencies more closely together in their rulemaking and supervisory activ\n",
      "ities. The relationships among existing agencies and the evolving practice of these new entities may in turn pose some novel practical and administrat\n",
      "ive law issues. My remarks this afternoon address some aspects of the job of creating a financial stability regulatory system in light of these featur\n",
      "es of Dodd-Frank and of the fact that theories of financial stability that might inform the fashioning of this system are in many respects still undev\n",
      "eloped or, at the least, contested. I will begin with a brief survey of Dodd-Frank's financial stability provisions before turning to a few examples. \n",
      "Dodd-Frank as a Statutory Framework for Financial Stability Regulation Dodd-Frank creates a legal and institutional framework within which financial s\n",
      "tability regulation is to be developed but, with a couple of notable exceptions, it does not delineate the steps that should actually be taken to prom\n",
      "ote financial stability. A useful point of comparison is the Banking Act of 1933, which did not use the terms \"financial stability\" or \"systemic risk,\n",
      "\" but which specified the Glass-Steagall rule separating commercial from investment banking, limited transactions of banks with their affiliates, and \n",
      "established the federal deposit insurance system to prevent banking runs and panics. While statutory modifications and considerable administrative imp\n",
      "lementation of course followed over the years, the key elements of the regulatory scheme for financial stability were contained within the original le\n",
      "gislation itself. In contrast, there are relatively few Dodd-Frank provisions that more or less directly effect the policy changes intended to reduce \n",
      "risks to financial stability. Even the so-called Volcker Rule, which prohibits proprietary trading by banks, bank holding companies, and their affilia\n",
      "tes,3 will require considerable regulatory build-out before its constraints will be clear. Provisions that require only modest administrative interpre\n",
      "tation, such as the limit on acquisitions that would bring a financial firm's consolidated liabilities to more than 10 percent of the aggregate consol\n",
      "idated liabilities of all financial companies,4 are not central elements of the legislation. At the risk of some oversimplification, one can classify \n",
      "most uses of the financial stability concept in Dodd-Frank into four categories: (1) as a goal for a new regulatory authority, (2) as an instruction f\n",
      "or ongoing analysis and monitoring, (3) as a direct legal standard, and (4) as a factor for consideration in decisions on applications for various pro\n",
      "posed actions subject to regulatory approval. First, financial stability is used as a stated goal motivating a new regulatory or supervisory authority\n",
      " without itself being the standard used in the realization of that authority. For example, Dodd-Frank reverses the restrictions that Gramm-Leach-Blile\n",
      "y placed on the powers of the Federal Reserve Board to examine subsidiaries of bank holding companies regulated by other agencies by referring explici\n",
      "tly to the Board's need to be informed of risks within the subsidiaries that may \"pose a threat to . . . the stability of the financial system of the \n",
      "United States.\"5 Another example is section 165, which requires that the Federal Reserve establish a special set of prudential requirements for bank h\n",
      "olding companies with more than $50 billion in assets in order to \"prevent or mitigate risks to the financial stability of the United States that coul\n",
      "d arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities of large, international financial institutions.\" Similarly, the far-rea\n",
      "ching requirement in Title VII that five federal financial regulators establish margin requirements for uncleared swaps written by swap dealers and ot\n",
      "her major market participants is intended to \"offset the greater risk to the [dealers] and the financial system arising from the use of [uncleared] sw\n",
      "aps.\"6  Second, Dodd-Frank takes a number of steps to enhance the capacity of the government to monitor and analyze threats to financial stability. Mo\n",
      "st prominent among these are the creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Office of Financial Research (OFR).7 The FSOC is\n",
      " composed of ten voting and five nonvoting members--the heads of relevant federal offices and regulatory agencies, and three representatives of state \n",
      "financial regulators.8 As I will discuss in a moment, the FSOC as a collective entity has a limited, though important, direct regulatory role. Much of\n",
      " its time, however, will be spent fulfilling its mandate from Congress to assess risks to financial stability, including--where appropriate--making re\n",
      "commendations for action to agencies under existing regulatory authority or to Congress to fill gaps in existing authority in response to identified s\n",
      "ystemic risks.9 The stated purpose of OFR is to support the FSOC and its member agencies through research, the collection and standardization of data,\n",
      " the development of tools for measuring and monitoring risk, and related activities.10 FSOC and OFR are each also required to make an annual report to\n",
      " Congress on financial stability.11  The third use of financial stability in Dodd-Frank is as a direct legal standard for the exercise of a regulatory\n",
      " authority, as opposed to my first category of Dodd-Frank provisions, which simply cite financial stability concerns as a motivation for a regulatory \n",
      "or supervisory program. To date, the most conspicuous of this type of provision have been the authorities granted the FSOC to designate nonbank financ\n",
      "ial companies and financial market utilities as \"systemically important.\" The first of these authorities is directed at financial firms that are not b\n",
      "ank holding companies, and thus not subject to capital requirements and other parts of the holding company regulatory regime. This authority is a dire\n",
      "ct response to experience in the financial crisis. During 2008, serious problems at AIG and the five so-called \"free-standing\" investment banks--that \n",
      "is, firms not part of a bank holding company--contributed substantially to the severe stress in the financial system, with the failure of Lehman Broth\n",
      "ers in September igniting the most acute phase of the crisis. The standard to be applied by the FSOC is whether \"material financial distress at the U.\n",
      "S. nonbank financial company, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of the U.S. nonbank finan\n",
      "cial company, could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.\"12 There follows a lengthy list of \"considerations\" to be taken int\n",
      "o account by the FSOC. However, particularly insofar as the last of these is \"any other risk-related factors that the Council deems appropriate,\"13 th\n",
      "e list does not provide extensive guidance for the FSOC in applying the basic standard. Any companies so designated by the FSOC will be subject to sup\n",
      "ervision by the Federal Reserve, as well as to the special Section 165 prudential standards I mentioned earlier. To date, no firms have been designate\n",
      "d, though the FSOC is actively considering possible designees. Of course, the five previously free-standing investment banks have either been dismantl\n",
      "ed (Lehman), converted into bank holding companies (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley), or absorbed into a bank holding company (Bear Stearns and Merri\n",
      "ll Lynch). The other designation authority granted the FSOC is for financial market utilities, defined as multilateral transfer, clearing, or settleme\n",
      "nt systems for payments, securities, or other financial transactions among financial institutions.14 Once designated as systemically important,15 fina\n",
      "ncial market utilities are subject to prudential standards established by the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodi\n",
      "ties Futures Trading Commission for the purpose of reducing systemic risk and supporting financial stability.16 Here, in addition to providing conside\n",
      "rations for the FSOC in making its determination, the statute elaborates the standard of \"systemically important\" a bit, defining that term to mean a \n",

       "'The Federal Reserve is best known for its role in the national economy and monetary policy. But through the 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country, it also gets involved in efforts to support local communities and their economies. This work helps to enhance our understanding of the pace of economic recovery and further creates a backdrop for a national dialogue about common problems and their potential solutions.              Over the last several years, every community across the country has felt the effects of the financial crisis. Foreclosed, vacant, and abandoned properties threaten neighborhoods nationwide, and community leaders are working to stabilize those neighborhoods. While the problem touches every community, it doesn\\'t look the same in each because it\\'s shaped by the circumstances that prevailed in those neighborhoods before the crisis hit.              Neighborhood stabilization efforts are critical, now more than ever, as not all communities will be stabilized without intervention. This is because the market will not correct equally in all places. Through the 12 Reserve Banks and the Board, the Federal Reserve System facilitates community development activities as communities strive to repair the damage wrought by the financial crisis. We participate in local collaboration efforts, help evaluate what\\'s working and what\\'s not, and highlight promising practices. We do this by combining research and local outreach, and also by bringing together financial institutions, policymakers, and community leaders.       Introduction of Three Federal Reserve Community Development Videos        While the Fed conducts all kinds of research analyzing economic trends, we\\'re also looking for new ways to identify and showcase replicable models. To that end, I\\'d like to share with you a series of stories we\\'ve produced that highlight various challenges faced by communities and targeted strategies to deal with them. Everyone has heard about the foreclosure crisis, but it helps to see what it really looks like. So, we\\'re featuring three very different cities in a series of video reports that will be accessible on the Federal Reserve\\'s website. These \"Reports from the Field\" showcase three promising stabilization efforts that highlight grassroots innovation and collaboration.       Cleveland        Cleveland neighborhoods face five decades of population loss, outmigration of jobs, and urban sprawl, in addition to the more recent wave of foreclosures. Despite these persistent challenges, city leaders have responded with dynamic leadership. In Cleveland, public and private partners have created an innovative stabilization strategy that uses targeted data to help community leaders focus scarce resources on the neighborhoods that have the best chance for success. This is a model that has great potential to be replicated in other cities. Let\\'s watch Cleveland\\'s story.              As the video highlights, Cleveland\\'s success is built around both on-the-ground community outreach and intensive data collection that helps to identify block-level and community-level trends. It showcases strong collaboration among city and county officials; nonprofits like Neighborhood Progress, Inc.; local foundations; and universities. The Northeast Ohio Community and Neighborhood Data for Organizing (NEO CANDO) provides cutting-edge analytical mapping tools, and these data help steer resources into neighborhoods where the money will have the greatest impact. This \"tipping point\" strategy relies on the comprehensive investment of public and private resources for sustained stabilization.       Phoenix        The crisis looks different in western states. Phoenix reminds us that the foreclosure problem has hit suburban as well as urban areas. The vacant homes here tend to be newer than in many parts of the country, but overbuilding has left a high proportion of foreclosed homes in a community that has never dealt with these issues at scale before. Here, public-private partnerships have reached out to real estate professionals to help connect eligible families with affordable homes. Let\\'s take a look at Phoenix.              Given that the problem in Phoenix has largely been shaped by overbuilding and falling home prices, Phoenix faces a much different set of post-foreclosure crisis issues than older industrial cities such as Cleveland or Detroit. In Phoenix, houses and sometimes entire subdivisions are often purchased by investors armed with cash and able to move faster than individual homebuyers. The challenge for those trying to revitalize neighborhoods is to ensure that qualified homeowners and non-profits are in a position to compete with investors for these now affordable homes, and the city and private sector have come together to achieve this goal.       Detroit        While population growth may eventually aid the recovery in places like Phoenix, communities like Detroit are faced with the opposite problem. In Detroit, the nexus between decades of population loss and the foreclosure crisis has created a pivotal moment in which the city must reinvent itself. With extensive economic challenges and an infrastructure designed for a much larger population, few easy solutions exist. The city is partnering with community leaders to bring together thousands of residents to help make the tough choices that will shape Detroit\\'s future. Let\\'s turn to Detroit.              As the video illustrates, Detroit is finding new solutions to the decades-long problem of stabilizing its neighborhoods and attracting new residents. The Detroit Works Project aims to reimagine the city\\'s geographic footprint and service range, based on the current smaller population. Detroit\\'s story reminds us that when ideas are controversial and hard choices must be made, community input and buy-in is critical for success. To this end, the project has hosted extensive community meetings and created a leadership taskforce to map out future growth and investment areas.       Conclusion        At the Federal Reserve, we have been working to understand the issues, help craft national policies, and collect data that can be used by government agencies and nonprofits. But sometimes a research paper or a speech doesn\\'t give you a true picture of what the foreclosure crisis really looks like. When I began my role as a Governor, I travelled to the 12 Reserve Bank Districts to see firsthand what was happening across the country. It was an eye-opening experience--one that has informed my perspective as a Governor. And these stories from around the country can help provide the same type of context for researchers and policymakers.              Here at the Federal Reserve we are learning more each day about the complex task of stabilizing communities in the wake of the crisis, and research and analysis of what is working is critical. From these video \"Reports from the Field,\" we\\'ve learned that collaborations and partnerships help achieve success; strategic targeting of limited resources may be necessary; data can help focus a strategy; community input and buy-in are critical for long-term planning; and different approaches will work for diverse challenges and places.              The Fed will continue to identify the needs and challenges facing communities by fostering a dialogue for a better understanding of community development practices. As the research conference unfolds over the next two days, we\\'ll learn more about what community development may look like going forward. While research and evaluation remain central to the Fed\\'s contribution, the System is equally well positioned to share best practices and foster partnerships: connecting at the local level, building networks, raising awareness of successes, and using data and research to evaluate what\\'s working and to suggest improvements.'"

I\\'m especially pleased as an economist and policymaker to discuss the importance of education to the success of our economy. At the Federal Reserve we spend a lot of time looking at economic data, such as production and employment. In doing so, we try never to forget that these seemingly sterile numbers are, in fact, reflections of the economic aspirations, opportunities, and well-being of millions of Americans. When individuals are denied opportunities to reach their maximum potential, it harms not only those individuals, of course, but also the larger economy, which depends vitally on having a skilled, productive workforce. As a result, we all have a stake in the essential work that you are doing for our children.              So how can we improve the opportunities for all children and give them a chance to succeed in our ever-changing, globalized economy? As the husband of a teacher and an educator myself, as well as a parent and former school board member, I know from personal experience that, for creating opportunity and changing lives, there is no substitute for a quality education. The research shows that effective educations lead to lower rates of poverty, higher lifetime earnings, and greater satisfaction on the job and at home. And specialists in economic development have identified educational attainment as a key source of economic growth and rising incomes in many countries around the world.              Although education and the acquisition of skills is a lifelong process, starting early in life is crucial. Neuroscientists observe that if the first few years of a child\\'s life include support for healthy development in families and communities, the child is more likely to succeed in school and to contribute to society as an adult. Conversely, without support during these early years, a child is ultimately more likely to drop out of school, earn lower wages, depend on government programs, or be incarcerated.1           Consistent with this research, early childhood education programs aim to nurture healthy development from the earliest years. Programs that provide enriched experiences for children and that also involve parents have shown to benefit children from all backgrounds, but they have the strongest influence on children from disadvantaged environments.2 Importantly, state preschool assessments have shown that early childhood education programs make children better prepared for school, a precursor of future success.3           The benefits of early childhood programs are not just short-term in nature. Careful studies demonstrate that early interventions can have a positive effect on young children from low-income families that lasts well into adulthood. For example, analysis of one program showed that children who attended a high-quality half-day preschool program at ages 3 and 4 were, at age 40, more economically successful--for example, more likely to own their own homes--than nonparticipants in a control group.4 In other evaluations, long-term benefits were demonstrated for a full-day early childhood education program starting before age 1 and for a nurse-based home visiting program.5           Economically speaking, early childhood programs are a good investment, with inflation-adjusted annual rates of return on the funds dedicated to these programs estimated to reach 10 percent or higher.6 Very few alternative investments can promise that kind of return. Notably, a portion of these economic returns accrues to the children themselves and their families, but studies show that the rest of society enjoys the majority of the benefits, reflecting the many contributions that skilled and productive workers make to the economy.7           The Federal Reserve has long supported increasing educational opportunity for children, including the youngest. Federal Reserve Banks have published articles and convened community forums on early childhood issues. For school-age children, we sponsor financial literacy and economic education programs. For these programs, we make a special effort to reach schools with high proportions of minorities and lower-income children.              Many of you in the audience today are still in school or have recently graduated. Your hard work demonstrates that you understand the value of a good education for yourself. With your efforts and the efforts of others, I hope we will one day achieve the Children\\'s Defense Fund\\'s goal of a level educational playing field for all children.              I wish you all the best in your conference and in your work. Thank you.        1.

In many spheres of human endeavor, from science to business to education to economic policy, good decisions depend on good measurement.  More subtly, what we decide to measure, or are able to measure, has important effects on the choices we make, since it is natural to focus on those objectives for which we can best estimate and document the effects of our decisions.  One great pioneer in this subject area, of course, is Simon Kuznets, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1971 for his work on economic measurement, including the national income accounts.  Over the years many economists have built on his work to further improve our ability to quantify aspects of economic activity and thus to improve economic policymaking and our understanding of how the economy works.  The remarkably broad and ambitious research program of this conference and the impressive expertise that has been assembled illustrate the continued vitality of this field.  Evolving technologies that allow economists to gather new types of data and to manipulate millions of data points are just one factor among several that are likely to transform the field in coming years.              As we think about new directions for economic measurement, we might start by reminding ourselves of the purpose of economics.  Textbooks describe economics as the study of the allocation of scarce resources.  That definition may indeed be the \"what,\" but it certainly is not the \"why.\"  The ultimate purpose of economics, of course, is to understand and promote the enhancement of well-being.  Economic measurement accordingly must encompass measures of well-being and its determinants.              In the tradition of national income accounting, economic policymakers have typically focused on variables such as income, wealth, and consumption.  The Federal Reserve has a statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability, which motivates our extensive efforts to monitor and forecast measures of employment and inflation.  Substantial research and the development of data collection infrastructures have, over the years, greatly enhanced our ability to receive timely and accurate measures of those variables.  Aggregate measures, such as gross domestic product and personal consumption expenditures, are useful for monitoring people\\'s ability to meet basic material needs and for tracking cyclical and secular changes in the economy as a whole.  Indeed, the experience of the recent financial crisis and the ensuing recession was strongly reflected in nearly all of these aggregate measures, indicating the severe economic stress felt by millions of people and hundreds of communities across the country.              But, as many of you will discuss this week, aggregate statistics can sometimes mask important information.  For example, even though some key aggregate metricsâ\\x80\\x91â\\x80\\x91including consumer spending, disposable income, household net worth, and debt service paymentsâ\\x80\\x91â\\x80\\x91have moved in the direction of recovery, it is clear that many individuals and households continue to struggle with difficult economic and financial conditions.  Exclusive attention to aggregate numbers is likely to paint an incomplete picture of what many individuals are experiencing.  One implication is that we should increase the attention paid to microeconomic data, which better capture the diversity of experience across households and firms.  Another implication, however, is that we should seek better and more-direct measurements of economic well-being, the ultimate objective of our policy decisions.               Although the field is still young, there have been interesting developments in the measurement of economic well-being.  In a commencement address two years ago titled \"The Economics of Happiness,\" I spoke about the concepts of happiness and life satisfaction from the perspective of economics and other social science research.1   Following the growing literature, I define \"happiness\" as a short-term state of awareness that depends on a person\\'s perceptions of one\\'s immediate reality, as well as on immediate external circumstances and outcomes.  By \"life satisfaction\" I mean a longer-term state of contentment and well-being that results from a person\\'s experiences over time.  Surveys and experimental studies have made progress in identifying the determinants of happiness and life satisfaction.  Interestingly, income and wealth do contribute to self-reported happiness, but the relationship is more complex and context-dependent than standard utility theory would suggest.2   Other important contributors to individuals\\' life satisfaction are a strong sense of support from belonging to a family or core group and a broader community, a sense of control over one\\'s life, a feeling of confidence or optimism about the future, and an ability to adapt to changing circumstances.  Indeed, an interesting finding in the literature is that the overwhelming majority of people in the United States and in many other countries report being very happy or pretty happy on a daily basisâ\\x80\\x91â\\x80\\x91a finding that researchers link to people\\'s intrinsic abilities to adapt and find satisfaction in their lives even in very difficult circumstances.3           This line of research has generated alternative measures of well-being that are frequently survey-based and incorporate elements such as psychological wellness, the level of education, physical health and safety, community vitality and the strength of family and social ties, and time spent in leisure activities.  These measures have begun to inform official statistics and have started to be discussed in policy debates.  An interesting and unique case is the Kingdom of Bhutan, which abandoned tracking gross national product in 1972 in favor of its Gross National Happiness index based on a survey that incorporates these types of indicators.  Taking the measurement of well-being in a cross-country framework, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), as part of its OECD Better Life Initiative, has created a \"better life index\" that allows a side-by-side comparison of countries according to various quality-of-life indicators that could, at least in principle, be followed over time.4   Other somewhat-more-conventional economic indicators that bear on quality of life, and that accordingly might be developed and followed in more detail, include changes in the distribution of income, wealth, or consumption; the degree of upward mobility in material measures of well-being; indications of job security and confidence about future employment prospects; and households\\' liquidity buffers or other measures of their ability to absorb financial shocks.  All of these indicators could be useful in measuring economic progress or setbacks as well as in explaining economic decisionmaking or projecting future economic outcomes.              Continued work on the measurement of economic well-being will likely lead to greater recognition by economists of the contributions of psychology--an area that has been explored by pioneers like 2002 Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman.  One topic on the frontier of economics and psychology is the neurological basis of human decisions, including decisionmaking under risk and uncertainty, intertemporal choice, and social decisionmaking.5   Researchers are investigating behavioral tendencies in a variety of circumstances--for instance, by examining human responses to perceived inequality, losses, risk, and uncertainty; the need for autonomy; and the importance for well-being of social ties and community.  For example, brain imaging research has documented differences in the brain regions that light up in response to losses and gainsâ\\x80\\x91â\\x80\\x91a clear physical manifestation of the \"loss aversion\" documented in the earlier behavioral studies in economics and psychology.6   Evolutionary psychologists suggest that humans experienced evolutionary benefits from brain developments that included aversion to loss and risk, and from instincts for cooperation that helped strengthen communities.               Measurement of well-being is an important direction, but just one of many new directions for economic measurement being explored in the field generally and at this conference in particular.  I am glad to see scholars and practitioners continuing to push the frontiers of economic measurement with a broad perspective and with open minds.  As Arthur Conan Doyle\\'s immortal character Sherlock Holmes aptly put it, \"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.\"7   As I said at the beginning, good economic analysis and policymaking depend on good measurement, and the work you are doing will accordingly yield significant benefits.  I thank you for the opportunity to give these short remarks, and I wish you the best for a productive and stimulating conference.                        1.  See Ben S.

Canonical models of economic decisionmaking presume individual maximization of \"utility,\" or well-being.  They tend to focus on the consumption of goods or services and assume that more consumption is preferred to less.  For example, see Andrew Mas-Colell, Michael D.
